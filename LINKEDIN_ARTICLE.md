We ran a 14-hour ML training job with Claude Code last week. 46 data shards, sequential YOLO fine-tuning on M4 Max.

The problem? You can't just walk away from an AI agent. Claude Code needed approvals, shards failed mid-run, and we wanted to check progress from our phone.

So we built Claude Remote Bridge and open-sourced it.


🔧 THE PROBLEM

Claude Code can't be interrupted externally. No push notifications, no webhooks, no way to nudge it remotely.

Our fix: A lightweight bridge daemon that uses ntfy.sh as a message bus.

Phone → ntfy.sh → Bridge Daemon → Claude Code
Claude Code → Bridge Daemon → ntfy.sh → Phone

It polls ntfy every 5 seconds, writes messages to a local inbox, and a Claude Code hook auto-checks it on every interaction.


⚡ THE KILLER FEATURE

Built-in queries. Send "q: training" from your phone. The bridge answers directly, no Claude interaction needed.

"Epoch 5/15 - 35% complete | Box: 2.3 | Cls: 1.9"

Also supports: disk space, running processes, log tails.


📱 HOW OUR 14-HOUR RUN WENT

Hour 3: "q: training" → Shard 15/46, loss trending down
Hour 8: "q: logs" → noticed early stopping on shard 21
Hour 12: notification → "7 early-stopped shards, running weighted avg retry"
Hour 14: "E9 complete. mAP50=0.040, +22% over baseline. RELEASE."

We sent "approved" from our phone. Claude exported the model and tagged the release. Zero keyboard time after launch.


🚀 SETUP TAKES 30 SECONDS

git clone, pip install requests, crb start, install hook. Four commands. Single dependency. No databases. Local files for queuing, ntfy.sh for transport.


Built for anyone running long Claude Code sessions: ML training, deployments, data pipelines, overnight builds.
